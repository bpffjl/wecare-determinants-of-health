# project_template
The template that I like for projects

## Create an R project in RStudio

## Use `{renv}`
See `renv` documentation [here]([url](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html))

## Commit to git

## Makefile

## Directory structure
The directory is structured by what type of files go in the folder. So all scripts go insite the `scripts` folder, all outputs go in the `outputs` folder. I differentiate between data that will be provided to others and data used for the project. Data used in the project goes into the `data` folder whereas data that will provided to others goes in the appropriate folder under the `output` folder.
